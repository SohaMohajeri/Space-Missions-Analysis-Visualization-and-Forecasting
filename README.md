Ever since the start of world war when the USSR launched the first ever man-made sattelite into the space called the Sputnik, the world has taken great interests in trying to explore beyond the planet. It provides immense national pride when launches are successful. However, it is also incredibly disheartening when the missions do nott succeed and millions of dollars and national dreams burst into flames.

In this notebook we will use Space_Mission_Dataset. This DataSet includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race (1957).There are three parts to our report, as follows:

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Prediction of Mission Status

Our first objective is to find out the number of missions versus different features, and analyze various successes and failures of the space organisations worldwide. Our second goal is to implement several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and XGBoost Classifier to predict whether the missions are successful or not. We will compare the results of these models to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.

In this multiphase project, we used five datasets including Metal-CNT Sensor Dataset, Research Centers-Countries Dataset, Pt-CNT Sensor Dataset, Sulfur Cathode Properties Dataset and CNT Synthesis Dataset. These datasets were obtained from the chemical experiments and research carried out at the University of Washington.
